1) Used Entity framework (DataBase First Approach).
2) Didn't included Async and await.
3) Created Trigger for Order table, when new order placed then for that new order it will update as "Placed" because intially the order should be Placed.
4) Didn't worked on Multiple orderItems for Single order, don't have idea, for multiple orderItems we can send through json array for ProductId, but Properties and methods in Entity framework no idea.
5) Didn't worked on authentication, instead of that, created UserRole table and inserted values as 
	i)  1 for User, 
	ii) 2 for Admin
While retrieving the values by using the userRole, appropriate values get fetch.
6) Created Tables relations as of my knowledge because we had backend team who can do those operations, so i checked few things and worked on that.
7) Tested in PostMan.
8) If the method name starts with Http Verbs (Get,Put,Post,Delete) then Http verbs are not required.
Instead of that I didn't included those verb names and included Http Verbs.
9) Didn't created any separate Repository for Code reusability.
10) Created Mail sending class after creating the new order and new order Id will send to Client, but am getting the error with Smtp, I tried for Maximum.
